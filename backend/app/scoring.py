"""Flakiness scoring.

A test that fails 100% of the time is broken, not flaky. Flakiness is
*instability*, so the primary signal is status FLIPS between consecutive
executions, weighted so recent flips matter more (geometric decay).

Signals combined:
1. flip score  — decayed rate of pass<->fail transitions over the last
   `window` executions (skipped executions are ignored).
2. same-SHA flips — a fail and a pass recorded on the SAME commit SHA is
   proof of nondeterminism (identical code, different outcome). Any such
   evidence puts a floor under the score.

Final score is in [0, 1].
